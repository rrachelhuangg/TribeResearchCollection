        "description":"To ensure the safety of autonomous systems, it is imperative for them to abide by their safety properties. The specification of such safety properties is challenging because of the gap between the input sensor space (e.g., pixels, point clouds) and the semantic space over which safety properties are specified (e.g. people, vehicles, road). Recent work utilized scene graphs to overcome portions of that gap, enabling the specification and synthesis of monitors targeting many safe driving properties for autonomous vehicles."

        "description":"The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has made their failures increasingly evident. Testing efforts aimed at identifying the inputs leading to those failures are challenged by the input’s long-tail distribution, whose area under the curve is dominated by rare scenarios. We hypothesize that leveraging emerging open-access datasets can accelerate the exploration of long-tail inputs. Having access to diverse inputs, however, is not sufficient to expose failures; an effective test also requires an oracle to distinguish between correct and incorrect behaviors. Current datasets lack such oracles and developing them is notoriously difficult. In response, we propose DIFFTEST4AV, a differential testing framework designed to address the unique challenges of testing AV systems."

        "description":"Do people trust social media? If so, why, in what contexts, and how does that trust impact their lives? Researchers, companies, and journalists alike have increasingly investigated these questions, which are fundamental to understanding social media interactions and their implications for society. However, trust in social media is a complex concept, and there is conflicting evidence about the antecedents and implications of trusting social media content, users, and platforms. More problematic is that we lack basic agreement as to what trust means in the context of social media. Addressing these challenges, we conducted a systematic review to identify themes and challenges in this field. Through our analysis of 70 papers, we contribute a synthesis of how trust in social media is defined, conceptualized, and measured, a summary of trust antecedents in social media, an understanding of how trust in social media impacts behaviors and attitudes, and directions for future work."

        "description":"Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation."

        "description":"Social anxiety (SA) has become increasingly prevalent. Traditional coping strategies often face accessibility challenges. Generative AI (GenAI), known for their knowledgeable and conversational capabilities, are emerging as alternative tools for mental well-being. With the increased integration of GenAI, it is important to examine individuals’ attitudes and trust in GenAI chatbots’ support for SA. Through a mixed-method approach that involved surveys (n = 159) and interviews (n = 17), we found that individuals with severe symptoms tended to trust and embrace GenAI chatbots more readily, valuing their non-judgmental support and perceived emotional comprehension. However, those with milder symptoms prioritized technical reliability. We identified factors influencing trust, such as GenAI chatbots’ ability to generate empathetic responses and its context-sensitive limitations, which were particularly important among individuals with SA. We also discuss the design implications and use of GenAI chatbots in fostering cognitive and emotional trust, with practical and design considerations."

        "description":"The pursuit of computational efficiency has led to the proliferation of throughput-oriented hardware, from GPUs to increasingly wide vector units on commodity processors and accelerators. This hardware is designed to efficiently execute data-parallel computations in a vectorized manner. However, many algorithms are more naturally expressed as divide-and-conquer, recursive, task-parallel computations. In the absence of data parallelism, it seems that such algorithms are not well suited to throughput-oriented architectures. This paper presents a set of novel code transformations that expose the data parallelism latent in recursive, task-parallel programs. These transformations facilitate straightforward vectorization of task-parallel programs on commodity hardware. We also present scheduling policies that maintain high utilization of vector resources while limiting space usage. Across several task-parallel benchmarks, we demonstrate both efficient vector resource utilization and substantial speedup on chips using Intel's SSE4.2 vector units, as well as accelerators using Intel's AVX512 units."

        "description":"The Intel Xeon Phi offers a promising solution to coprocessing, since it is based on the popular y86 instruction set. However, to fully utilize its potential, applications must be vectorized to leverage the wide SIMD lanes, in addition to effective large-scale shared memory parallelism. Compared to the SIMT execution model on GPGPUs with CUDA or OpenCL, SIMD parallelism with a SSE-like instruction set imposes many restrictions, and has generally not benefitted applications involving branches, irregular accesses, or even reductions in the past. In this paper, we consider the problem of accelerating applications involving different communication patterns on Xeon Phis, with an emphasis on effectively using available SIMD parallelism. We offer an API for both shared memory and SIMD parallelization, and demonstrate its implementation."

Developers can then record a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the project that most likely contain the reported bug."

This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the issue resolution process implemented in practice by analyzing the issue reports of Mozilla Firefox."

The basic idea is to delegate to an LLM the assessment of the “quality” of the output provided by an automated technique (often another LLM) for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only tell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be too expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can also unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a solution for a given instance of the task (e.g., an answer to a question) and others judging and deciding what is the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of LLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code summarization."

As such, understanding the capabilities and limitations of such models is becoming critical. However, the abilities of these models are typically measured using automated metrics that often only reveal a portion of their real-world performance. While, in general, the performance of NCMs appears promising, currently much is unknown about how such models arrive at decisions. To this end, this paper introduces $d o _ { c o d e }$, a post hoc interpretability method specific to NCMs that is capable of explaining model predictions. $d o _ { c o d e }$ is based upon causal inference to enable programming language-oriented explanations. While the theoretical underpinnings of $d o _ { c o d e }$ are extensible to exploring different model properties, we provide a concrete instantiation that aims to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations by grounding explanations of model behavior in properties of programming languages."
